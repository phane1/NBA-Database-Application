# NBA Database Application

## Introduction

Since my childhood, I have been deeply fascinated by the NBA, and this passion for the sport has never diminished. The thrill of watching the game continues to inspire me, and I find myself instinctively drawn to closely tracking the statistics of specific players and thoroughly analyzing the performances of all the players on my favorite team. It has become a regular habit that I am not alone in.

NBA fantasy leagues have gained widespread popularity, much like fantasy leagues for any other sport. One of the most nerve-wracking aspects of each season is the player drafting process, as player performance can be highly unpredictable. Achieving success in fantasy leagues heavily relies on reviewing player statistics meticulously. However, manually calculating these stats each time can be tedious and monotonous.

The primary objective of this application is to alleviate this burden by providing users with a streamlined solution. It allows users to easily access and look up highly specific statistics tailored to their needs. By eliminating the need for manual calculations, the application aims to enhance the overall user experience and save valuable time, thereby making the fantasy league journey more enjoyable and rewarding.

## Future Development

This project was primarily developed for my Database Management class under tight time constraints. Despite the challenges, I take pride in the accomplishments I have achieved. The code functions as intended, with a significant amount of time dedicated to debugging and resolving errors.

Looking ahead, I envision further enhancing this project by completely revamping the user interface. While the Python Command-Line Interface (CLI) served its purpose, I believe transitioning to a web browser-based interface would greatly improve the user experience. This shift would enable users to interact with the database more conveniently, allowing them to easily view and manipulate data in a visual and intuitive manner, as opposed to working with it line by line in a terminal environment.
